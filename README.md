<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great covid19 resources/information apps out there, however,I decided to create this one in order to further help in making information readily available to everyone
We need to be very informed at all times with happenings around us inorder for some reasons

Here's why:
* To help provide useful information with friends and family to keep everyone safe
* To be updated with statistical cases trend around us
* To easily get access to advisories and faq's from trusted sources

Of course, no one app will serve all needs since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
